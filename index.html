    <p class="First" id="About_me">Hello, My name is Aditya Chunduru, I'm a student here at NECC as an IT major.
      I chose this field because i've always been interested in learning more about technology advances and even stuff that exist on our 
      everyday devices that we never even considered using such as a built in command prompt, how sites like google were made.
